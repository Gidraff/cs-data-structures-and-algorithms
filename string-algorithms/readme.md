#### String Functions and Algorithms

In this chapter, I learnt common string functions in Javascript that I can leverage in my algorithms. I found `split()` function useful, for example, in a scenario where you want to create subarray from a string, or when you want to _split_ a string into an array of characters for looping.

With practice, you can get creative with the following functions:

- `.charAt(arg)`
- `.subString(arg)`
- `.indexOf(arg)`
- `.split(arg)`
- `.replace(arg)`

Not forgetting the regex-related functions provided by the _String Object_:

- `exec()` : Test for matches, and returns the first match
- `test` : Test for matches, and returns a boolean (`true` or `false`)

We can use Regex object functions to match patterns in a string. Regex Object provides the following methods that you can use.

- `search()` : Test for matches in a string, and returns the match
- `match()` : Test for matches , and returns all the matches
