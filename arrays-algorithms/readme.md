#### Arrays

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures.

Js arrays come with a lot of built-in methods that allows you to perform:
- Insertion: e.g `arrayName.push(item)`. Adds a new element to the end of the array.
- Deletion: e.g `arrayName.pop()`: remotes the last-added element of the array. Also returns the removed element.
- Access: Done by specifying the index. E.g `arrayName[index]`
- Iteration: The process of accessing each of the items contained within a data structure.
